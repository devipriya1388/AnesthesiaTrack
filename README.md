Anesthesia Track
Anesthesia Track is a web application designed to help healthcare professionals efficiently manage and track anesthesia-related patient records. This application provides a streamlined interface for recording, retrieving, and managing essential patient data, procedure details, and notes.

Features
User Interface and Authentication
Secure Login: A clean, responsive login page built with Tailwind CSS.

Patient Registration: A comprehensive form for collecting patient demographics, procedure types, vitals, and allergies.

Records Viewer: A card-based layout to easily view stored patient data, including vitals and notes.

Notes Interface: A dedicated section for adding and viewing post-operative and anesthesia-related notes for each patient.

Success Page: A confirmation screen displayed upon successful data submission.

Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
HTML5 + CSS3	Provides the foundational structure and styling.
Tailwind CSS	A utility-first framework used for modern, responsive styling.
Flask (Assumed)	Handles backend routing and server-side logic.
Python (Assumed)	The backend server language.
Note: Flask and Python are assumed for the backend logic due to the use of Jinja templating ({{ url_for(...) }}).
